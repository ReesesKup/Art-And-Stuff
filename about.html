          One thing i personally enjoy, and believe that many other will enjoy as well is exploration of nature. While there might not be anything that hasnt been previously discovered it doesnt mean it cannot be enjoyed. Walks through nature can be extreamely peaceful. The sounds of birds chirping and leaves rustling in the wind are very serene to most. While amittibaly this might not be for everyone, why not give it a try? why not get outdoors instead of sitting infront of a screen.
